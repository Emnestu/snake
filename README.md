# Snake

This was my first Model-View-Controller game. It is a clone of the classic "Snake" game, such as the one on Nokia 3310.

To run, download and compile all Java files, then launch the "Control" file.

In the game, you control the snake using the arrow keys. Eating food makes your snake's tail grow. The game ends if you bite your own tail. You can press the "Restart" button at any time to restart the game.
